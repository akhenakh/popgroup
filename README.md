# PopGroup

## Ideas
- One binary to start
- Create a DNS entry
- Try to open router ports UPNP ?
- Create an SSL certificat at Let's encrypt
- Automatically create new groups at https://dyndns../groupXXX
- Provide a simple multiuser chat with files exchanges (pictures but also any file types)
- Later support WebRTC
